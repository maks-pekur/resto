-- 0080_tenancy_erase_tenant_pii.sql
-- 10.2 plan 18: migration 0079 merged brands into tenants and correctly
-- dropped `DELETE FROM brands` from tenancy_erase_tenant (the table is
-- gone) but did not replace it with anything. Before the merge, erasing a
-- tenant hard-deleted the whole `brands` row, which erased `legal_name`,
-- `legal_form`, `tax_id` and `stripe_account_id` along with it. Those
-- columns now live on `tenants`, which is never deleted (it is the
-- tombstoned root aggregate) -- so since 0079, a real GDPR erasure has
-- been silently leaving a restaurant's legal name and tax id behind.
-- Signature is unchanged, so no DROP FUNCTION is needed first.
